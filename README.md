# Mole Network

Mole network is a tool that supports the process of generating Backbone, Metro core and Metro aggregation segments of a network.
It is written in Python.
The repository includes several files including:

- A main.py file to run the GUI for Backbone network generation.
- A mainMetroCore.py file for the Metro Core generator GUI.
- A mainMetroAggregation.py file for the Metro Aggregation network generator GUI
- A create_all_topology.py script that generates a sample topology from backbone to aggregation (Note: change the "directory" variable to point to the desired directory to store the outputs)
